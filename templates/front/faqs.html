<h1 id="pitch-subtitle">What should I do? I'm not getting notifications</h1>
<p id="pitch-text">
<br/>
    If you have added checks but you do not seem to be getting notifications, please ensure that
    you have signed up for an email integration from the integrations tab.
    In addition to this, unless a check has been pinged for the first time you will not get e-mail notifications.
    Therefore ensure you ping your notification immediately after you add it.
